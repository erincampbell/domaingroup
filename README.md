## Domain Group Job Interview Test

Hi There!

Contained here are my files for the hCard test.

To get it up and running you will need to:
	* Download this git: https://github.com/erincampbell/domaingroup.git
	* run npm init
	* run webpack
	* run gulp

And you should be off and running.

It took a little longer than the suggested 6 hours - more like 8 or 9. But React is still new to me, so I was a little slow, mainly in the set up. But then I was off and racing.

Any questions - erin@ekcdesigns.com.au

Thanks,
Erin
